\abstract{Abstract:	This thesis presents a study of relatively computationally inexpensive smoothing methods applied on meshes of various shape and sizes. It has been known in literature that delaunaynizing new vertex location can be more effective than just vertex relocation. While flipping in 2D is simple and proven to be effective, flipping in 3D does not give such guarantess. In the process, we choose and implement four algorithms for triangular and tetrahedral meshing with immediate flipping. Immediate flipping have been mentioned in the literature before but lacks experimental data especially for tetrahedral meshes. Later, we compare these four methods in terms of speed, quality and grading of the mesh.
