\abstract{Abstract:	This thesis talks about a new smoothing method for isometric tetrahedral meshes focused on improving aspect ratio of the elements. This new method is extension of aspect ratio based smoothing algorithm in 2D for triangular meshes. The 2D method is improved variant of laplacian based smoothing method. This thesis work extends the 2D method by applying flipping of non delaunay edges immediately after relocation of each interior mesh vertex to new position and shows the aggressive improvement in mesh quality. Then this method is extended to 3D and is tested further with flipping/swapping of faces/edges similar to 2D. Later, comparison of this new algorithm with other smoothing algorithms and applicability is discussed along with experimental results.
